Java

A high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. Java is an object-oriented language similar to C++, but simplified to eliminate language features that cause common programming errors. Compiled Java code can run on most computers because Java interpreters and runtime environments, known as Java Virtual Machines (VMs), exist for most operating systems, including UNIX, the Macintosh OS, and Windows. 

C

C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language. Many later languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C, including C++, D, Go, Rust, Java, JavaScript, Limbo, LPC, C#, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, Verilog (hardware description language).By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.

C++

C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing the facilities for low-level memory manipulation.C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms and provided by various organizations, including the FSF, LLVM, Microsoft and Intel.

Java Script 

JavaScript is a dynamic programming language.[5] It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed.JavaScript is classified as a prototype-based scripting language with dynamic typing and first-class functions. This mix of features makes it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented,[7] imperative, and functional[1][8] programming styles.

Php

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.
PHP code can be simply mixed with HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various templating engines and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter, which is usually implemented as a web server's native module or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable.



Compared to C#

C# To Java

C# and Java are actually quite similar, from an application developer's perspective.Reference types are very similar to pointers in C++, particularly when setting an identifier to some new class instance.
Both C# and Java are Object-Oriented Languages.

C# to C and C++

C# is directly related to C and C++. C is a root for C++ and C++ is a superset of C. C and C++ shares several syntax, library and functionality. In addition structures, unions, arrays, strings and pointers are most important and similar functionality for both languages. C# inherits most of its operators, keywords, and statements directly from C++. Enums are clearly a meaningful concept in C++. While there are a number of differences between C++ and C#, the syntax of C# is not very different from C++ and the transition to the new language is more easy with RAD environment of .NET. 

C# to JavaScript
In C# functions (methods) have to be attached to a class. In Javascript they don't. The why is in the language definition (spec).

C# to PhP
PHP generates directly the HTML / JS / CSS used to compose the page and produce the end HTML page directly from the code or if you are smart enough using things like templates engines. You must know HTML at least to be able to develop PHP web sites.
